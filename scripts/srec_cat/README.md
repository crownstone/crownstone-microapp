Example scripts to show how `srec_cat` can be used to calculate the CRC16 CCITT according to the "BAD" implementation, see http://srecord.sourceforge.net/crc16-ccitt.html.

This is the one that is used on Nordic:
	CRC-16/AUG-CCITT

This is the one that is normally calculated by `srec_cat`:
	CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE
