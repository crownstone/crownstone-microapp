# Bluenet module

Create a module that can be run from Crownstone code. Very first implementation.

# Organization

The files can be found in `include` and `src`. There is an example file in the root directory called `example.c`. The
results can be found in the `build` directory.

# Targets

Find out the targets through `make help`. Summarized, `make`, and `make flash` (to program the device).
